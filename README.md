# Maze Solver Software | C++ , OpenCV, DFS, Graph Algorithms
1. Constructed a software which inputs a 2D maze image and visually depicts the algorithm trying to solve with a moving cursor.
2. Formulated a DFS Recursive Algorithm which signals cursor movement to solve the maze while exploring simultaneously.
